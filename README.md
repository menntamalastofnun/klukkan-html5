# klukkan-html5

An educational clock game written in html5.

Rewritten from a flash game, link to flash: http://vefir.nams.is/klukkan/klukkan.htm

Language: Icelandic. Should be easy to port to other languages (would need audio (or skip audio) and text fixes, and for programming clarity: filename changes into english).
